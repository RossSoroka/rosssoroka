		<h3>About Me</h3>

		<h2>Ever since I was young I always loved cars. From playing with Hotwheels to spending hours on Need For Speed, that love is what originally pulled me into the life of photography. Once I got my Subaru Impreza in 2015 thats when I really started to take car photos with my cell phone. The more photos I took, the more I wanted to take!

A year later is when I decided to dive deeper into it and got my first DSLR camera. This is when my photography career really kicked off!

Fast forward to today. With years of experience and an ever growing knowledge and love for photography I've expanded into more than just car photography. This driving passion has led me to experimenting with other styles such as landscape and product photography and boy does it put a smile on my face when I nail "that shot". I'm always looking forward to learning new things and being able to give clients exactly what they want plus more! </h2>
