		<h3>About Me</h3>

		<h2>Ever since I was young I had a growing passion for cars. That passion I have for cars is what originally drew me towards photography. I first started taking photos with my cell phone after I got my Subaru Impreza in 2015. My passion kept growing with the more photos I took. Jump forward a year, seeing how much better other peoples photos looked compared to mine drove me to buying my first DSLR camera which just pushed my love for photo taking to a whole new level. 

Fast forward to today. With years of experience and an ever growing knowledge and love for photography I've expanded into more than just car photography. This driving passion has led me to experimenting with other styles such as landscape and product photography and boy does it put a smile on my face when I nail "that shot". </h2>
