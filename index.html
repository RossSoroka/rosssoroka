		<h3>About Me</h3>

		<h2><p>Ever since I was young I always loved cars. From playing with Hotwheels to spending hours on Need For Speed, that love is what originally pulled me into the life of photography. In 2015 I purchsed a Subaru Impreza and began my automotive photography journey. The more photos I took, the more I wanted to take!<p>


<p>A year later I decided to dive deeper and got my first DSLR camera. This is when my photography career really kicked off! Being able to take a vision in my mind and transform it into an image for the world to see is such a  rewarding feeling. </p>


<p>Fast forward to today-  with years of experience as well as an ever growing knowledge and love for taking photos, I'm expanding into more than just car photography. This driving passion has led me to experiment with other styles such as landscape, product photography and videography.!</p> </h2>
